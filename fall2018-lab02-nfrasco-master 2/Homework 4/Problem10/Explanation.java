		// It can be broken down into him rolling a 6, twice rather than rolling a pair.
		// that's because that's exactly what it is. He had 24 chances to roll something that had a 1/6 probability 
		// of happening. 
		
		// In regards to him losing the bet where he had 4 chances to roll a 6, 
		// the probability of him rolling a six in one turn would have been 1/6.
		// now getting the chance to roll that six with just 3 more tries as opposed to 23 more times
		// is quite limiting. All in the stats and probability
